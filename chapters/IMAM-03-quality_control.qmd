# Important!

In the next steps we are going to copy-paste code, adjust it to our needs, and execute it on the command-line.

For simplicity's sake, most steps will be geared towards an analysis of a single sample. It is recommended to follow a basic file structure like the following below:

```         
my_project/
├── raw_data/          # Contains the raw, gzipped FASTQ files
│   ├── sample1_R1_001.fastq.gz
│   ├── sample1_R2_001.fastq.gz
│   ├── sample2_R1_001.fastq.gz
│   └── sample2_R2_001.fastq.gz
└── results/           # This is where the output files will be stored
└── log/               # This is where log files will be stored
```

When running any command that generates output files, it's essential to ensure that the output directory exists *before* executing the command. While some tools will automatically create the output directory if it's not present, this behavior is not guaranteed. If the output directory doesn't exist and the tool doesn't create it, the command will likely fail with an error message (or, worse, it might fail silently, leading to unexpected results).

To prevent a lot of future frustration, create your output directories beforehand with the `mkdir` command as such:

``` bash
mkdir -p results
mkdir -p log
# Create a subdirectory
mkdir -p results/assembly
```

## Merging and decompressing FASTQ

Any file in linux can be pasted to another file using the cat command. zcat in addition also unzips gzipped files (e.g. .fastq.gz extension). If your files are already unzipped, use cat instead.

**Modify and run:**

``` bash
zcat {input.folder}/{sample}_R1_001.fastq.gz > {output.folder}/{sample}_R1.fastq
zcat {input.folder}/{sample}_R2_001.fastq.gz > {output.folder}/{sample}_R2.fastq
```

-   `{input.folder}` is where your raw .fastq.gz data is stored.
-   `{sample}` is the name of your sample.
-   `{output.folder}` is where your decompressed .fastq files will be stored.

## Deduplicate reads

This step removes duplicate reads from the uncompressed FASTQ files. Duplicate reads can arise during PCR amplification or sequencing and can skew downstream analyses. We'll use the cd-hit-dup program to identify and remove these duplicates.

After cd-hit-dup command is finished, we'll remove the .clstr file that cd-hit-dup creates. This file contains information about the clusters of duplicate reads, but it's not needed for downstream analysis, so we can safely remove it to save disk space.

``` bash
cd-hit-dup -u 50 -i {input.R1} -i2 {input.R2} -o {output.R1} -o2 {output.R2}

rm {output.dir}/*.clstr
```

-   `{input.R1}` and `{input.R2}` are the decompressed R1 and R2 reads from **step 2.1**.
-   `{output.R1}` and `{output.R2}` are your deduplicated .fastq reads. Think of where you want to store your results, something like `results/dedup/` will be sufficient, so output.R1 turns into `result/dedup/SampleName_R1.fastq`, etc.
-   `{output.dir}` This should be pointed to wherever your deduplicated reads are stored.

## Running fastp quality control software

The [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) software is a very fast multipurpose quality control software to perform quality and sequence adapter trimming for Illumina short-read and Nanopore long-read data.

**Run and modify:**

``` bash
fastp -i {input.R1} -I {input.R2} \
-o {output.R1} -O {output.R2} \
--unpaired1 {output.S} --unpaired2 {output.S} --failed_out {output.failed} \
--length_required 50 \
--low_complexity_filter \
--cut_right \
--cut_right_window_size 5 \
--cut_right_mean_quality 25 \
--thread {threads} \
-j {output.J}/qc_report.json -h {output.H}/qc_report.html
```

-   `{input.R1}` and `{input.R2}` are the reads belonging to the deduplicated sample **step 2.2**.
-   `{output.R1}` and `{output.R2}` are the the quality controlled .fastq filenames.
-   `{output.S}` --unpaired1 and --unpaired2 tells fastp to write unpaired reads to a .fastq file. In our case, we write unpaired reads (whether they originated from the R1 or R2 file) to the same file, output.S.
-   `{output.failed}` .fastq file that stores reads (either merged or unmerged) which failed the quality filters
-   `{sample}` is the name of your sample.
-   `{output.J}` is the directory for the json report file
-   `{output.H}` is the directory for the html report file

::: callout-note
`{threads}` is a recurring setting for the number of CPUs to use for the processing. On a laptop this will be less (e.g. 8), on an HPC you may be able to use 64 or more CPUs for processing. However, how much performance increase you get depends on the software.

## Host filtering

This step removes reads that map to a host genome (e.g., human). This is important if you're studying metagenomes from a host-associated environment (e.g., gut microbiome, skin surface).

To improve computational speed and reduce memory usage, it is required to index your reference sequence before proceeding to the host filtering step.

``` bash
# Index reference genome
bwa index {reference}

# Host filtering
bwa mem -aY -t {threads} {reference} {input.R1} {input.R2} | \
samtools fastq -f 4 -s /dev/null -1 {output.R1} -2 {output.R2} -
bwa mem -aY -t {threads} {reference}  {input.S} | \
samtools fastq -f 4 - > {output.S}
```

-   `{input.R1}` and `{input.R2}` are QC-filtered FASTQ files from **step 2.3**.
-   `{output.R1}` and `{output.R2}` are FASTQ files (R1, R2) containing reads that did not map to the host genome.
-   `{input.S}` are singleton reads from the previous step (output.S).
-   `{reference}` is a reference genome sequence.

::: callout-note
We now have our quality controlled sequence reads which we can use to create an assembly in the next chapter.
