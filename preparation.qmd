## Activating the correct conda software environment

[Anaconda](www.anaconda.org) is a software management tool that can be used for creating specific environments where bioinformatics software can be installed in Linux, as it manages all the dependencies of different softwares for you. To run the steps outlined in this manual, be sure to first activate the proper conda environment. 

Activate a conda environment can be done by copying and executing the following code:

``` bash
conda activate {environment}
```

-   `{environment}` is the name of your chosen conda environment.

We are now ready to start executing the code to perform quality control of our raw Nanopore sequencing data in the next chapter.
